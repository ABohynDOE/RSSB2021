	abstract = {We specify an algorithm to enumerate a minimum complete set of combinatorially non-isomorphic orthogonal arrays of given strength t, run-size N, and level-numbers of the factors. The algorithm is the first one handling general mixed-level and pure-level cases. Using an implementation in C, we generate most non-trivial series for t=2, N≤28, t=3, N≤64, and t=4, N≤168. The exceptions define limiting run-sizes for which the algorithm returns complete sets in a reasonable amount of time. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Combin Designs 18: 123–140, 2010},

In particular, we bring the description of the best known program nauty up to date and describe an innovative approach called Traces that outperforms the competitors for many difficult graph classes. Detailed comparisons against saucy, Bliss and conauto are presented.},
